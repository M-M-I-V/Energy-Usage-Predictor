🏭 Energy Usage Predictor (Regression, No External APIs)

📖 Overview
This project predicts the energy consumption of a machine or section of a factory based on simple features such as hour of the day, temperature, and machine operating status. Unlike complex industrial energy management systems, this is designed for rapid prototyping with beginner-friendly ML models.

Key applications:

Identifying peak energy usage hours

Suggesting potential energy savings

Simple forecasting for machine scheduling

🎯 Goal
Given historical hourly energy usage data with environmental and operational features, predict the energy consumption for the next day. Visualize predictions against actual usage and highlight periods with high consumption.
